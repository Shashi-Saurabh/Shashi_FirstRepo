First week of IIT PATNA was enjoyble. Made new friends and meet with people from different parts of India.I was also disappointed when i came to know that there is no wifi in our new aryabhatta hostel and hope to it to soon get installed.I liked the fact that seniors are very supportive.I also enjoyed the DJ night.
